## Appendix

1) Body hydration level mainly depends on: Surrounding temperature or environment, food and beverages you consume each day, age, weight, health, activity level etc.

2) Why is water so important to body function?

i)Water is essential in every system and function of the body, and has many responsibilities. For example, water:
is a building block of new cells and the key nutrient every cell relies on for survival
metabolizes and transports proteins and carbohydrates from the food you eat to nourish your body

ii)Helps the body flush waste, mainly through urine.

iii)Helps maintain a healthy body temperature through sweat and respiration when the temperature rises
is part of the “shock absorber” system in the spine

iV)Protects sensitive tissue is part of the fluid that surrounds and protects the brain and a baby in the womb
is the main ingredient in saliva helps keep joints lubricated

3)  Calculating water consumption:

To calculate how much water you should drink daily to maintain a healthy amount of water in your body, divide your weight in pounds by 2 and drink that amount in ounces.

For example, a 180-pound person should aim for 90 ounces of water, or about seven to eight 12-ounce glasses, each day.

Keep in mind that you can consume water in a variety of ways. A glass of orange juice is mostly water, for instance.

Be careful, though, because caffeinated beverages, such as coffee, tea, or certain sodas, can have a diuretic effect. You will still retain a lot of the water in those drinks, but the caffeine will make you urinate more often, so you’ll lose more fluid than you would drinking water.

Alcohol has also diuretic properties and isn’t a healthy way to reach your water-consumption.
